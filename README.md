Big Data System (CS 744) Fall 2019

This class will introduce key concepts and state-of-the-art in big data systems. After covering the basics of modern hardware and software infrastructures that these systems leverage, we will explore the systems themselves from the ground up.

Specifically, topics we cover will include:

Cluster architecture
Big Data stacks: Hadoop, Spark
Scheduling and Resource Management
Machine learning
Batch and stream analytics
Graph processing
Serverless platforms
